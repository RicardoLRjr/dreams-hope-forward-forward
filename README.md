This is the readMe for my personal blog, Dreams, Hope, Forward, Forward!

It's still under construction, but when it's finished, it will have a variety of posts on my life, coding journey, and other things that interest me!

It's built with Gatsby and the Gatsby-Starter-Blog starter, as a way for me to learn the Gatsby ecosystem, and will eventually be integrated into the rest of my blogs, which include a blog on my sporting opinions, 70 X Takeoff, and a planned blog about my career journey, which has yet to be named, but will probably just be my name. 

Thanks for visiting!
